                    <strong> Our project</strong> is an  application  that allows users to explore different cultures through their traditional cuisine. <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <strong> Users </strong>can select any country and access a page that provides information about the most popular traditional dishes in that country. <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <strong> Additionally,</strong> the platform features a tip calculator that helps users navigate cultural norms around tipping in different countries. <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    One of the most exciting aspects of  out  project is the food experiences list, which allows users to track their culinary adventures and share them with others.<br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    This feature creates a sense of community and encourages users to step outside of their comfort zones and try new things. <br></br>
                    <br></br>
